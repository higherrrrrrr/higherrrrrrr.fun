# Higherrrrrrr Monorepo - Revolutionary Memecoin Launchpad & Token Evolution Framework

## 🚀 Overview

**Higherrrrrrr** is a groundbreaking **memecoin launchpad and token evolution framework** built with a focus on **community-driven innovation**, **transparency**, and **robust on-chain engineering**. This monorepo contains all the code and resources necessary to run the Higherrrrrrr ecosystem, from Solana smart contracts and EVM services to the frontend application and supporting scripts.

Our aim is to bridge the vibrant world of meme culture with cutting-edge blockchain technology, creating a platform that is both engaging and secure. We leverage token evolution mechanics, conviction NFTs, and advanced trading features to offer a unique and dynamic experience for memecoin creators and communities.

This monorepo is structured to facilitate modular development and clear separation of concerns between different parts of the Higherrrrrrr ecosystem.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project

To run the entire Higherrrrrrr ecosystem locally, you'll need to set up and run each service individually. Refer to the README.md files within each subdirectory in `services/` for detailed instructions. Here's a high-level overview:

1.  **API Service (`services/api`)**:
    - Set up Python 3.11+ and PostgreSQL.
    - Configure environment variables in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
    - Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Run the Flask development server: `flask run`.

2.  **Frontend App (`services/app`)**:
    - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed.
    - Install JavaScript dependencies: `yarn install`.
    - Configure environment variables in `.env.local` (copy from `.env.example`).
    - Start the Next.js development server: `yarn dev`.

3.  **Protocol (Solana Contracts) (`services/protocol`)**:
    - Install Rust, Solana CLI, and Anchor CLI.
    - Build the Solana program: `anchor build`.
    - Deploy the program to localnet: `anchor deploy`.

4.  **EVM Services (`services/evm`)**:
    - **Ponder Indexer (`services/evm/ponder`)**:
        - Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`.
        - Configure environment variables in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).
        - Start the Ponder development server: `npm run dev`.
    - **RPC Cache (`services/evm/rpc`)**:
        - Ensure Docker is installed.
        - Build the Docker image: `docker build -t rpc-cache .`.
        - Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 rpc-cache`.
    - **Subgraphs (`services/evm/subgraphs`)**:
        - Requires TheGraph CLI to be installed globally.
        - Navigate to `services/evm/subgraphs/tokens`.
        - Configure subgraph manifest (`subgraph.yaml`) with your endpoint.
        - Build and deploy the subgraph using TheGraph CLI commands (refer to `package.json` scripts).

**Note**: Running all services requires a comprehensive setup and configuration. For development purposes, you might choose to run only the services you are actively working on.
