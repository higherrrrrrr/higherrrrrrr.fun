# Higherrrrrrr Protocol

> **Higherrrrrrr** – Where cults meet on-chain engineering!

This project is a Solana program built with Anchor. It implements a meme token with evolving metadata, conviction NFT rewards, custom AMM pools, and unique fee mechanics. Follow these instructions to reset your environment, install all prerequisites, and get started with development.

## Resetting Your Environment

### Resetting Rust

If you want to completely reset your Rust installation (for a clean start):

1. **Uninstall rustup (and Rust toolchains):**

   ```bash
   rustup self uninstall
   ```

2. **Remove residual directories:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cargo ~/.rustup
   ```

*Note: This will remove all globally installed Cargo binaries and toolchain data.*

### Clearing Node Modules

To remove all Node.js dependencies and start fresh:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json  # (or yarn.lock if you use Yarn)
npm install
```

---

## Installation

### Install Rust

Rust is required for writing Solana programs. The recommended installation method is via rustup.

1. Install Rust with:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
   ```

2. Reload your shell's environment:

   ```bash
   . "$HOME/.cargo/env"
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

   You should see output similar to:

   ```
   rustc 1.80.1 (3f5fd8dd4 2024-08-06)
   ```

### Install the Solana CLI

The Solana CLI provides tools to build and deploy Solana programs.

1. Install the Solana CLI by running:

   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
   ```

2. If prompted, update your PATH. For example, add the following line to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
   ```

3. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   solana --version
   ```

   Expected output (version numbers may vary):

   ```
   solana-cli 1.18.22 (src:9efdd74b; feat:4215500110, client:Agave)
   ```

### Install Anchor CLI Using AVM

The Anchor Version Manager (AVM) lets you manage multiple Anchor versions easily.

1. **Install AVM:**

   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
   ```

2. **Verify AVM is installed:**

   ```bash
   avm --version
   ```

3. **Install the desired Anchor CLI version (e.g., v0.30.1):**

   ```bash
   avm install 0.30.1
   avm use 0.30.1
   ```

4. **Verify Anchor CLI:**

   ```bash
   anchor --version
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   anchor-cli 0.30.1
   ```

*If you encounter errors regarding dependency versions (e.g. with the `time` crate), see the troubleshooting section below.*

---

## Building the Project

In the project root (where `Anchor.toml` and `Cargo.toml` reside), run:

```bash
anchor build
```

This compiles the Solana program in `programs/protocol` and produces deployable artifacts.

---

## Running Tests

The project includes integration tests written in TypeScript.

1. Ensure Node.js dependencies are installed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run tests via Anchor:

   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

   Alternatively, if your `package.json` includes a test script, run:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

---

## Project Structure

- **Anchor.toml** – Main configuration for the Anchor project.
- **Cargo.toml** – Workspace configuration that includes the Solana program.
- **docs/TOKENOMICS.md** – Detailed tokenomics and design overview.
- **programs/protocol/** – The Rust program implementing the protocol.
- **tests/** – Integration tests in TypeScript.
- **migrations/** – (Optional) Deployment migration scripts.

---

## Key Features

- **Fixed Supply Token Creation**: Create tokens with immutable supply and pre-configured distribution splits.
- **Evolving Metadata**: Tokens can change their name and art based on price thresholds.
- **Conviction NFTs**: Reward large holders (≥0.042069% of supply) with special NFTs.
- **SimpleAMM Pools**: Built-in AMM with constant product formula (x*y=k) supporting:
  - Balanced liquidity provision
  - Single-sided liquidity (for fair launches)
  - Fee collection and distribution
  - Jupiter integration compatibility
- **Fee Management**: Configure fees for protocol revenue, creator rewards, and liquidity reinforcement.

---

## Additional Information

- **Local Cluster:** The project is configured to use a local Solana network (`localnet`). To run a local validator, use:
  
  ```bash
  solana-test-validator
  ```

- **Wallet:** Your provider wallet is defined in `Anchor.toml` (default: `~/.config/solana/id.json`). If you need a new wallet, run:

  ```bash
  solana-keygen new
  ```

- **Deploying the Program:** When you're ready to deploy to your local cluster, run:

  ```bash
  anchor deploy
  ```

- **Troubleshooting Dependency Issues:**  
  If you encounter errors such as:

  ```
  error[E0282]: type annotations needed for `Box<_>`
  ```
  
  This is due to an outdated dependency version (e.g. the `time` crate). To fix this when installing via AVM, you may need to:
  
  1. Clone the Anchor repo locally,
  2. Update the dependency (e.g., force `time` to version `>=0.3.35` using a patch override in `Cargo.toml`), and then
  3. Install Anchor CLI from your local copy:
     
     ```bash
     cargo install --path . --locked --force anchor-cli
     ```
     
  However, using AVM should typically handle version management for you.

## Jupiter Integration

To integrate your SimpleAMM pools with Jupiter, follow these steps:

1. **Register your pools with Jupiter**: Submit your pool information to Jupiter's DApp registry.

2. **Implement the required interface**: Ensure your SimpleAMM has the following:
   - Emit proper `SwapEvent` events with all required information
   - Have proper slippage protection with `min_amount_out` parameter
   - Make your pools discoverable with standard PDA derivation

3. **Test with Jupiter SDK**: Use Jupiter's SDK to test swap routing through your pools.

Example of integrating with Jupiter in your frontend:

```typescript
import { Jupiter } from '@jup-ag/core';
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Setup Jupiter
const connection = new Connection('https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com');
const jupiter = await Jupiter.load({
  connection,
  cluster: 'mainnet-beta',
  user: wallet.publicKey,
});

// Find routes for a swap
const routes = await jupiter.computeRoutes({
  inputMint: new PublicKey('...'),  // Token A mint
  outputMint: new PublicKey('...'), // Token B mint
  amount: 1000000000, // Amount in lamports/smallest unit
  slippageBps: 50, // 0.5% slippage
});

// Execute the best route
const { execute } = await jupiter.exchange({
  routeInfo: routes.routesInfos[0],
});
const swapResult = await execute();
```

For more details, check the [Jupiter documentation](https://docs.jup.ag/).
