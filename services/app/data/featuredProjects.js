      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">About Wen Lamboo</h2>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
      Buckle up degen, and fill your gas tank with hopium, because 'Wen Lamboo' is hurtling into the Higher-verse!
      <p class="mt-4">
       This is no simple a meme, but an on-chain reality, a manifestation of our collective desire for Lamborghinis.  Local Lambotonist Magpie is here to share his roadmap to Valhalla.
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Q:</strong> What's the deal with the Lamboo meme?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>A:</strong> If you've spent more than five minutes in crypto, you've heard it before: "Wen Lambo?" It's the battle cry of every brainlet dreaming of the moon and hoping to flex in a supercar. But here's the twist â€” we're turning that meme into an actual onchain journey, where with any luck, you'll end up with a Lamboorghini in your wallet. However, the ultimate question is: will that bring you happiness, or will you always be left wanting more?
     <p class="mt-8"></p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Q:</strong> Why is it called Lamboo?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>A:</strong> We wanted to stand out a bit from the countless other $LAMBO tickers. But importantly, I think that's actually how they pronounce it in Italy. LambOOrghini. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Q:</strong> Why launch on Higher?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Higher is the perfect platform for answering the question 'Wen Lambo?', because thanks to evolving token metadata, your token literally transforms as Marketcap rises.
     <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        One day you've got a token called 'Toyota Corolla', the next it's a 'Porsche GT3', and if things get wild, you're suddenly holding a 'Lamborghini Aventadoor' or 'Countach'. It's like watching your net worth level up in real-time, and everything is on-chain, with custom artwork and Conviction NFTs for every stage.
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        $25k marketcap â†’ Toyota Corolla (humble beginnings, but good enough for SBF)<br/>
        $75k marketcap â†’ BMW M3 (now we're talking)<br/>
        $250k marketcap â†’ Lamboorghini Urus (officially Lamboo territory)<br/>
        $1M+ marketcap â†’ Hypercars & ultra-rare Lamboos (pure degen ecstasy)
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        And if we go on a moon mission and hit the mega numbers? Well... keep reading.
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Q:</strong> How High Can $LAMBOO Go?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> We've set some absurd milestones, because why not?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        $50M marketcap â†’ "Lamboos Galore"<br/>
        $100M marketcap â†’ "Lamboos 4 All"<br/>
        $500M marketcap â†’ "Lamboo-topia"<br/>
        $1 Billion marketcap â†’ "Lamboo Enters the Gates of Valhalla" ðŸš€
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        By the final ascension, we're all retired, and more importantly, all driving Lamboos.
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
        <strong>Q:</strong> Very ambitious! But why will people ape into $LAMBOO?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> At the end of the day, it's just a playful twist on a very well-known meme. But also, thanks to Higher's unique tech, we've got a meme with actual progression, real-time hype, and a built-in reason to care about Marketcap movements. Brainlets love Lamboos, and now they get to watch their portfolio literally evolve into one. LFG

        <strong>Q:</strong> What are the tokenomics?
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Here's the breakdown:
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
        <strong>SUPPLY:</strong> 1 Billion tokens
      </p>
      <p>
        10% is locked for Treasury, with the remaining 90% in the single-side LP on Orca DEX.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        On every swap, there's a 1% Fee, split between token side ($LAMBOO) and SOL:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Token Side:</strong><br/>
        â€¢ 0.3% gets burned (deflationary aspect)<br/>
        â€¢ 0.2% creator fee
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>SOL Side:</strong><br/>
        â€¢ 0.25% supports liquidity floor (maintains SOL liquidity, adds buy-side depth, reduces price collapses)<br/>
        â€¢ 0.25% protocol fees for Higherrrrrrr platform

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">About Harder</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">
        $HARDER is the first on-chain evolutionary token. The higherrrrrrr we go, the longerrrrrrr we grow. Team's 10% locked in a multi-sig, 5% paired with $CULT for LP (HARDER burns, the CULT drives the floor). Evolve. Expand. Ejaculate liquidity.
      <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Why is $HARDER not the protocol token?</strong><br/>
        $HARDER is the first evolutionary token, and we want to keep it that way. It was never the protocol token, but it was the first token. Users will have the option to migrate $HARDER from Base to Solana. To not dilute existing hodlers via a new price discovery mechansism and mint, we opted to launch our protocol token $CULT, which will act as the primary base asset for the LP. We have always intended to launch a protocol token, but decided launching it now, in this fashion, is the most optimal.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>What is with the $HARDER floor and burn mechanics?</strong><br/>
        For the uninitiated, this may seem hard to understand, but it's actually quite simple! When trades happen, half of the LP fee in $HARDER is automatically burned from supply - making it more scarce. The other half of the LP fee in $CULT is added back to the liquidity pool to help absorb sell pressure! What this means is that over time, $HARDER supply goes down and there is a fat stack of $CULT waiting to weather the jeet sells. Simple, based, bullish.

      <p class="mt-2">
        CULT is Higherrrrrrr's native protocol token and self-burning agent of chaos. 1B tokens, 0.5% burned + 0.5% SOL floor fuel on every trade. Hold 420,690 $CULT for Conviction NFTs when the cult evolves. Launch: 65% fair pool, 15% to Base OGs via airdrop, 15% team locked in a multi-sig (7.77% for current team w/ vesting, 7.23% for future uses), and 5% for migrated token LPs,. Ascend or gtfo.
        <p class="mt-8"></p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Why launch $CULT?</strong><br/>
        We have always intended to launch an evolutionary cult coin for the true believers in the Higherrrrrrr gospell. The Solana migration was the perfect opportunity to launch our protocol token which will act the as membership card to all things Higherrrrrrr!

      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Wen airdrop?</strong><br/>
        We will be airdropping 15% of the $CULT supply to the faithful, those that have supported Higherrrrrrr from the beginning on Base. We plan do to a snapshot and reward all token communities using Higherrrrrrr on Base. Don't ape a bunch of smol cap tokens degens, we will be normalizing for MC - BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Why pair 5% of $CULT with Migrated Tokens in an LP?</strong><br/>
        Well degen, we BELIEVE in the CULT OF HIGHER^7! Put more simply for the slower in the group, pairing the tokens inherently links the succes of each together, if $CULT does well, so do migrated tokens and vice versa. A degen match cultivated in chaos.

      <p class="mt-2">
        IDK is the first hyper-meta, self-aware token that perfectly encapsulates the vibe of modern markets.
        It expands infinitely as the community does... or doesn't. It's a living shrug that laughs in the face 
        of decentralization, financialization, and logic itself.

        <strong>Migration</strong><br/>
        Migrated $IDK will enter price discovery using a single-sided CULT LP provided by the Higher^7 team. 
        This will enable deep liquidity for $IDK on Solana via the $IDK/$CULT pair.
