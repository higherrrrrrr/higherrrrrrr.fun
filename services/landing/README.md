# 🚀 Higherrrrrrr.fun

A new type of asset exchange that unlocks revolutionary forms of onchain expression. Not tokens. Not NFTs. A new meta that transforms memes from ephemeral culture into tradeable capital.

## 🌟 Overview

Higherrrrrrr.fun is built on the premise that memes are humanity's first truly democratic language - a force that transcends traditional barriers of culture and class. Our platform introduces evolutionary tokens that grow and transform with their communities, creating a new paradigm for digital assets.
