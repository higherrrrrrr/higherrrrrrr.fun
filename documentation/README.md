## Guidelines for Adding New Documentation
This directory is designed to grow as the **Higherrrrrrr** project evolves. Here are some tips for maintaining clarity and structure when adding new content:

1. **Use Descriptive Filenames**:
   - File names should clearly reflect the document’s purpose (e.g., `roadmap.md`, `community-guidelines.md`).

2. **Follow the Formatting Standard**:
   - Use Markdown headings and consistent formatting for readability.
   - Include a brief introduction or summary at the top of each file.

3. **Link New Files Here**:
   - Add a section in this README to describe the new document.
   - Include a short summary and specify the target audience.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Use versioning in filenames (e.g., `whitepaper-v2.md`) for major updates.

5. **Separate Categories**:
   - As the directory grows, consider organizing files into subfolders (e.g., `legal/`, `technical/`, `community/`). Update this README to reflect the structure.
