## 1. Introduction & Motivation

The **Memecoin Launchpad & Evolutionary Token Platform** (hereafter, the “Platform”) on Solana is designed to streamline the **creation** and **management** of community-driven tokens that incorporate:

- **Fixed Supply Mechanics**: A fully minted supply (e.g., 1 billion tokens with 9 decimals) that is locked at creation.  
- **Dynamic, Threshold-Based Metadata**: On-chain logic that updates each token’s displayed name or artwork as it meets certain price or market thresholds (e.g., "level up" events).  
- **Big Holder (Conviction) NFTs**: Reward addresses holding above a certain fraction of the total supply whenever a threshold crossing occurs.  
- **Fee Splits**: Systemically distribute token-based fees to the **creator** side while directing the SOL-based fees to the **protocol** side.  
- **Optional Single-Sided Liquidity**: Provide a fair launch experience by enabling tokens to deposit only their side of the liquidity pool, letting the market supply the counterpart asset (usually SOL).

This TDD aims to detail every relevant piece of the on-chain architecture, highlighting the data structures, instructions, security checks, and potential future expansions.

## 2. High-Level Goals

1. **Usable Memecoin Framework**: Allow new projects to spin up “fun, hype-based” tokens with reliable **trust-minimized** code on Solana.  
2. **No Additional Minting**: Once the total supply is minted, the mint authority is burned, ensuring no unexpected inflation.  
3. **Evolving Token Identity**: Each token can embed comedic or brand-centric evolution triggers, changing its name or URIs as the price or volume crosses new thresholds.  
4. **Conviction-Based Rewards**: Large stakeholders (≥ a threshold % of supply) can claim or automatically receive special NFTs signifying their “conviction” or loyalty.  
5. **Secure Fee Infrastructure**: Protocol-based instructions seamlessly route fees to PDAs, with minimal risk of misappropriation.  
6. **Flexible Deployment**: The program can be configured to remain upgradable under a multisig or locked permanently for immutability.  

---

## 3. Core Accounts & PDAs

Solana programs rely on **accounts** and **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** for state management. Below are the **key** PDAs that unify the platform logic.

### 3.1. `MemeTokenState`

**Purpose**: Track essential data for each launched memecoin.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct MemeTokenState {
    pub creator: Pubkey,           
    pub mint: Pubkey,              
    pub name: String,              
    pub symbol: String,            
    pub supply: u64,               
    pub decimals: u8,              
    pub evolutions_pda: Pubkey,    
    pub registry_pda: Pubkey,      
    pub fee_vault_pda: Pubkey,     
    // Additional fields or references to aggregator, if needed
}
```

**Likely Seeds**: `[b"meme_token_state", creator_pubkey, mint_pubkey]`.

- **creator**: The wallet or entity that initiated token creation.  
- **mint**: The SPL token mint that now has a locked supply.  
- **name/symbol**: Display references for quick on-chain checks (though the actual displayed name may be updated via Metaplex).  
- **evolutions_pda**: A pointer to the `EvolutionData` account.  
- **registry_pda**: A pointer to the `ConvictionRegistry`.  
- **fee_vault_pda**: References the `FeeVault` for collecting fees.

---

### 3.2. `EvolutionData`

**Stores** threshold-based instructions for how the token’s name/URI changes when crossing certain triggers (price, volume, etc.).

```rust
#[account]
pub struct EvolutionData {
    pub owner: Pubkey,              // the authority controlling updates
    pub evolution_count: u8,
    pub evolutions: Vec<EvolutionItem>,
}

#[derive(AnchorSerialize, AnchorDeserialize, Clone)]
pub struct EvolutionItem {
    pub price_threshold: u64,
    pub new_name: String,
    pub new_uri: String, // optional reference to new artwork
}
```

**Likely Seeds**: `[b"evolution_data", mint_pubkey]`.

- This account can hold **5**, **10**, or **unlimited** evolution steps, depending on space allocated.  
- The `owner` is typically the **MemeTokenState** or the same as `creator`, ensuring only authorized calls can mutate these records.

---

### 3.3. `ConvictionRegistry`

**Purpose**: A ledger of addresses that have “registered” themselves as big holders (≥ some fraction like 0.42069% of total supply).

```rust
#[account]
pub struct ConvictionRegistry {
    pub token_mint: Pubkey,
    pub holder_count: u32,
    pub holders: Vec<Pubkey>, 
}
```

**Likely Seeds**: `[b"conviction_registry", mint_pubkey]`.

- Each user calls `register_holder` upon crossing the threshold.  
- The protocol references this account whenever a threshold-based “evolution” occurs to distribute “Conviction NFTs.”

---

### 3.4. `FeeVault`

**Purpose**: Store references to **where** fees go—namely, the PDAs or token accounts that hold them.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct FeeVault {
    pub protocol_sol_vault: Pubkey,   
    pub creator_token_vault: Pubkey,  
    pub protocol_pubkey: Pubkey,      
    pub creator_pubkey: Pubkey,       
    pub lp_token_vault: Pubkey,       
    // Possibly store fee rates or distribution parameters
}
```

**Likely Seeds**: `[b"fee_vault", mint_pubkey]`.

- **protocol_sol_vault**: A system account (or associated token account for wSOL) that accumulates the SOL side of fees.  
- **creator_token_vault**: An SPL token account that receives the token side of fees.  
- **lp_token_vault**: If the protocol invests fees into an AMM and gets LP tokens back, store them here.  
- **protocol_pubkey** / **creator_pubkey**: Distinct addresses that can call withdrawal instructions. Typically the protocol side is a global treasury, and the creator side is the memecoin project’s address.

---

## 4. Instruction-Level Workflows

### 4.1. `create_meme_token`

**Core**: Sets up a new memecoin, including mint creation, locking supply, setting up PDAs.

1. **Args**:  
   - `(name, symbol, supply, decimals, distribution_list, etc.)`  
   - Possibly a bool for “pre_mint” logic if you want to distribute some tokens upfront.  

2. **Flow**:  
   1. Create and initialize the SPL **mint**.  
   2. Mint up to the full supply to designated addresses.  
   3. Set mint authority to `None`, **locking** the total supply.  
   4. Create the **MemeTokenState** with references to newly initialized PDAs (`EvolutionData`, `ConvictionRegistry`, `FeeVault`).  
   5. Possibly store initial config in `FeeVault` (like fee rates, distribution addresses).

3. **Validation**:  
   - The signer must be the “creator,” ensuring random users can’t create a MemeTokenState claiming the same seeds.  
   - If a “pre_mint” is used, ensure it doesn’t exceed the supply.

---

### 4.2. `set_evolutions`

**Purpose**: Populate or update the array of `(price_threshold, new_name, new_uri)` in `EvolutionData`.

- **Args**: `Vec<EvolutionItem>`, each item specifying a threshold and new metadata.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Check that the caller is the `owner` of `EvolutionData`.  
  2. Replace or append items in `evolutions`.  
  3. Possibly reorder them by ascending threshold for simpler lookups later.

**Corner Cases**: If new evolutions are introduced after some have already triggered, the program can skip them if the price is already beyond that threshold.

---

### 4.3. `register_holder`

**Adds** a user to the `ConvictionRegistry` if they hold ≥ X% (like 0.42069%).

1. **Args**: Potentially just `( )`, since the user’s identity and token account can be derived from context.  
2. **Flow**:  
   1. The user passes in their token account.  
   2. Program checks `token_account.amount >= threshold_amt`.  
   3. If valid, add user’s `Pubkey` to the `holders` vector in `ConvictionRegistry`.  
3. **Validation**:  
   - Must confirm the user’s token account is indeed owned by them.  
   - If user is already in the list, do nothing (or increment a “registration version” if needed).

**Performance**: Storing an unbounded number of holders can be challenging; typically, you limit the maximum or store them in multiple pages. But if you expect ~200 or fewer big holders, it’s manageable in a single vector.

---

### 4.4. `distribute_conviction_nfts`

**Rewards** big holders with an NFT each time the token crosses from level `k` to `k+1`.

1. **Trigger**: Called after an evolution threshold is crossed, or after a “metadata update” event.  
2. **Flow**:  
   1. Load `ConvictionRegistry`.  
   2. For each holder in `holders`, confirm they still hold ≥ X%.  
   3. If yes, **mint** them an NFT referencing “the old level.” If no, remove them from the registry.  
   4. Possibly do this in batches if you expect more than can fit in a single transaction.  

3. **NFT Minting**:  
   - Typically uses a CPI call to **Metaplex** `create_metadata_accounts_v3` or a minimal “NFT standard” instruction.  
   - The minted NFT might store fields like “Conviction NFT – Level 3,” or embed a dynamic SVG referencing the date/time.

---

### 4.5. `update_metadata`

**Updates** the displayed name and/or URI using Metaplex instructions.

1. **Args**: Possibly `(current_price: u64)`, or the program obtains this from an aggregator.  
2. **Flow**:  
   1. Compare `current_price` with the items in `EvolutionData`.  
   2. Determine if a threshold is newly surpassed.  
   3. Construct a Metaplex `update_metadata_accounts_v2` instruction with the new name/URI.  
   4. Optionally call `distribute_conviction_nfts` if a level changed.  
3. **Validation**:  
   - The Metaplex “update authority” must be the **Platform** program’s PDA or a known address.  

---

### 4.6. `trade_via_ammpool`

**Allows** a user to swap tokens (SOL ↔ MemeToken) while letting the Platform auto-collect fees:

1. **Args**: `(amount_in, min_out, user_in_token_acct, user_out_token_acct, etc.)`.  
2. **Flow**:  
   1. **Calculate** a fee portion (e.g., 1% of `amount_in`).  
   2. If `user_in_token == SOL`, deposit that fee portion into `protocol_sol_vault`.  
   3. If `user_in_token == MemeToken`, deposit that fee portion into `creator_token_vault`.  
   4. **CPI** into Orca’s `swap` for `(amount_in - fee)`.  
   5. Check if new price crosses an evolution threshold; if so, call `update_metadata`.

**Complexities**:  
- The program must handle “wrapped SOL” if user_in_token is SOL.  
- If the user is swapping MemeToken → Another SPL token, some logic might direct a portion of that other SPL token as protocol fees; adjustments are possible but typically you focus on the MemeToken & SOL case.

---

### 4.7. `withdraw_protocol_sol` & `withdraw_creator_tokens`

**Purpose**: Let each side retrieve the fees.  
- **`withdraw_protocol_sol`** checks that the caller matches `FeeVault.protocol_pubkey`, then transfers lamports from `protocol_sol_vault` to the requested account.  
- **`withdraw_creator_tokens`** checks if the caller is `FeeVault.creator_pubkey`, then uses an SPL `transfer` from `creator_token_vault` to their personal token account.

Both instructions can impose optional additional checks, like time-locked withdrawals or vesting constraints if desired.

---

## 5. Fee Collection & Distribution

### 5.1. Default Scenarios

1. **Buying MemeToken with SOL**:  
   - 1% of `SOL` side → protocol.  
   - The user receives `(amount_in - fee)` worth of tokens from Orca.  
2. **Selling MemeToken for SOL**:  
   - 1% of `MemeToken` side → creator.  
   - The user receives `(amount_in - fee)` worth of SOL from Orca.

### 5.2. Configurable Rates

- The platform can store `fee_rate_bps` (e.g., `100` = 1%) inside `FeeVault`.  
- Sub-splits can be introduced: e.g., half burned, half to the creator, or some portion to an on-chain treasury.  
- If upgradability is retained, these rates can be changed over time by the protocol/creator via a governance or multisig approach.

### 5.3. Storing & Withdrawing Fees

All fees land in:

- **`protocol_sol_vault`** for SOL.  
- **`creator_token_vault`** for MemeToken.  

At any point, the respective authority can call a “withdraw” instruction to claim them. This ensures a **clean separation** of roles:

- The **creator** never touches the SOL side.  
- The **protocol** never touches the token side.

---

## 6. Metadata Evolutions & NFT Rewards

### 6.1. Evolving Metadata

**Key**: The on-chain name/symbol embedded in the SPL mint are typically static, so the platform relies on the **Metaplex** program for dynamic display updates. Once a threshold is hit:

1. The program sets the **Metaplex “update authority”** to itself or a delegated address at creation time.  
2. `update_metadata` modifies the `name` or `uri` in the Metaplex `MetadataAccount`.  
3. Wallets or explorers referencing the token’s Metaplex metadata see the new name/URI.

### 6.2. Conviction NFTs

#### 6.2.1. Threshold Setup

- Typically a fraction like 0.42069% for comedic effect or 0.1% for simpler logic.  
- The actual raw integer is `(threshold_percent * total_supply)`, factoring in decimals.

#### 6.2.2. Registry & Distribution Flow

1. A user calls `register_holder` if they surpass the threshold.  
2. On a new evolution level crossing, `distribute_conviction_nfts` loops over `holders`.  
3. It prunes those that no longer meet the threshold.  
4. Mints an NFT to each valid address.  

#### 6.2.3. NFT Mint Details

- Each NFT is typically a standard Metaplex token with `1` supply, referencing an artwork or quick SVG.  
- The program can embed comedic text referencing the old name or threshold.  
- Recipients can hold or trade these NFTs on standard marketplaces.

## 7. Single-Sided Liquidity & AMM Integration

### 7.1. Why Single-Sided?

Many projects prefer a “fair” approach where the project team only deposits their token. The broader market or community will deposit the counterpart (SOL), setting a fair market price.

### 7.2. Orca Pool Creation

**Instruction**: `create_pool_with_single_side` (optional, but typical for a “fair launch”).
1. The memecoin deposits X tokens into Orca’s liquidity pool.  
2. The protocol or user might receive some **LP tokens** in `lp_token_vault`.  

Below is the **continuation and conclusion** of the **Memecoin Launchpad & Evolutionary Token Platform – Technical Design (Extended Version)** document, picking up from **Section 7.3** onward. 

---

## 7.3. Ongoing Liquidity Management

1. **Add Liquidity**:  
   - If the memecoin’s creator or the protocol wishes to deepen liquidity, they can deposit additional tokens (and possibly SOL) into the same Orca pool.  
   - In return, they receive more LP tokens, which are held in the `lp_token_vault` or distributed as they see fit.

2. **Remove Liquidity**:  
   - Burn LP tokens from the `lp_token_vault` to reclaim the underlying token and SOL.  
   - This process can be used to redistribute partial liquidity or execute buybacks.

3. **Fee Integration**:  
   - A portion of the fees collected (in either SOL or tokens) can be automatically reinvested into the liquidity pool.  
   - This advanced strategy helps maintain a more stable price floor, though it increases the complexity of fee logic.

By allowing the protocol or creator to manage these LP positions, the Platform supports a variety of liquidity provisioning strategies, from purely “fair launch” to actively managed pools.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1. Program Upgrade Authority

- **Multisig** (e.g., Squads): The recommended approach is to place the upgrade authority under a 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 multisig, allowing safe upgrades if bugs or improvements are needed.  
- **Immutable**: If the community demands maximum trustlessness, the upgrade authority can be set to `None`, making the code unchangeable.

### 8.2. Permissioned Calls & PDA Ownership

- **create_meme_token**: Only the designated “creator” can call this to avoid collisions or unauthorized token creation under the same seeds.  
- **FeeVault**: Withdraw instructions check if the caller matches the relevant pubkey (creator vs. protocol).  
- **EvolutionData**: Only the authorized owner (or the program’s PDA) can modify thresholds or name/URI mappings.  
- **ConvictionRegistry**: `register_holder` ensures the user actually holds ≥ X%. The program verifies they own the relevant token account.  

### 8.3. Data Validation & Overflow Handling

- For each instruction, careful arithmetic checks prevent integer overflow (especially around 10^9 or 10^18 raw token amounts).  
- The program ensures no negative outcomes (like underflow when subtracting fees).

### 8.4. Metaplex Update Authority

- The token’s Metaplex metadata must be set so that only the Platform’s **PDA** (or another controlled address) can call `update_metadata`. If set incorrectly, a malicious party could override name/URI.

### 8.5. Registry Size Constraints

- Storing large lists of big holders on-chain can be expensive. The protocol can impose a max registry size, or store multiple “pages” if more than N addresses sign up.  
- If the threshold is high enough, the maximum number of potential holders remains small (~200 or fewer).

### 8.6. Off-Chain Price Feeds

- If the platform relies on an **oracle** (like Pyth) to get a price, verifying its authenticity is critical. Typically, you read from a Pyth account on-chain. If passing the price manually, the instruction must trust the signers or incorporate a known aggregator feed to mitigate manipulation.

---

## 9. Possible Extensions & Future Work

1. **Tiered Conviction NFTs**  
   - Instead of a single threshold, define multiple tiers (e.g., ≥0.1%, ≥0.42%, ≥1%), awarding different NFT “rarities” based on the user’s stake.

2. **DAO Governance**  
   - Integrate a governance token or use the memecoin itself as a voting mechanism. Allow changes to fee rates or thresholds via on-chain proposals.

3. **Bridging & Cross-Chain**  
   - Add instructions to lock tokens in a Wormhole (or similar) bridge contract, creating a cross-chain version of the memecoin on EVM or other L2 solutions.

4. **Buyback & Burn**  
   - The protocol or creator could define an automatic buyback mechanism when the price dips below certain thresholds, using fee or treasury funds.

5. **Advanced Liquidity Farming**  
   - The platform could stake its LP tokens in yield farms or aggregator vaults, distributing extra rewards back to the protocol or token holders.

6. **Staking & Tiered Utility**  
   - Offer direct staking instructions where holders can lock tokens on-chain to gain benefits (e.g., additional NFT tiers, reduced swap fees, etc.).

7. **Multi-Sig to DAO Transition**  
   - Over time, the multi-sig authority could be transferred to a decentralized DAO structure on Realms (SPL Governance).

8. **Open IDLs for Aggregators**  
   - Provide a standard interface for Jupiter or other aggregators to integrate “evolution triggers” or “conviction logic” even if users trade outside the official front end.

## 10. Conclusion

The **Memecoin Launchpad & Evolutionary Token Platform** detailed here brings together:

- **Locked Supply** with a comedic or brand-centric approach.  
- **Threshold-Based Metaplex Evolutions**, enabling dynamic name/URI changes as price or volume milestones are met.  
- **Conviction NFTs**, rewarding large holders with unique collectibles each time a “level up” occurs.  
- **Fee Splits** where the **protocol** receives SOL side fees and the **creator** receives token side fees, all tracked via on-chain PDAs.  
- **Single-Sided Liquidity** for fair launch price discovery, plus optional advanced liquidity management.

By consolidating these features into a **single Anchor program** (or modular set of programs), the Platform offers **meme token creators** a powerful, extensible, and **secure** foundation. They can customize supply, thresholds, and fee configurations, while trusting established best practices for immutability (once audited and finalized) or progressive governance via multisig and potential DAO transitions.

Ultimately, the **Platform** unites fun meme dynamics with **serious, trust-minimized** tokenomics on Solana—empowering new communities to launch, evolve, and reward loyal holders in ways that are both **transparent** and **efficient**.
