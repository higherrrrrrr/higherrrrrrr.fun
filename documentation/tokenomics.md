# Higherrrrrrr Community Brief

Welcome, deviants, to the **Higherrrrrrr** community tokenomics overview. This doc is your biblical resource for the **Higherrrrrrr** protocol token on Solana—how *Base V1 Supporters*\* fit in, why we have “Conviction NFTs,” and how the “floor mechanism” works. We’ll mention the ticker **once**—*it’s called **CULT***—but after that, it’s just “the token.”

## Quick Degen Analogy: “On-Chain Arcade Machine”

Imagine a giant arcade machine:

- You toss in **tokens** when you want to play (trade).  
- Half of your coin (0.5%) is **burned**—like the arcade ripping up your credits so no one else can use them.  
- The other half (0.5%) in **SOL** is used to **refill the prize pool** (the liquidity floor), so there’s always more plushies in the claw machine if the market price dips.  

Over time:

1. **Token Supply** shrinks (from constant burns).  
2. **Floor Liquidity** grows, so big dumps get absorbed.  

That’s how **Higherrrrrrr** keeps the game going for degens.

## 1. Summary (tl;dr)

- **LP Fees:** 1% total fee on trades (via Orca/Jupiter).  
  - **0.5%** of the **token side** is burned (removed from supply).  
  - **0.5%** of the **SOL side** is added as single-sided liquidity to help stabilize the token price.  
- **Conviction NFTs:** Holding **≥ 0.042069%** of the supply (420,690 tokens) grants you special NFTs (or “relics”) every time the token “evolves.”  
- **Distribution & Allocations:**  
  - **Team**: 20% total in a multisig (7.77% current team w/ vesting, 12.33% future expansions)  
  - **Migration LP Support\***: 5%  
  - **Base V1 Supporters\***: 15%  
  - **Single-Sided Launch Pool**: 60%  
- **Evolutionary Mechanics:** Certain market cap (or price) thresholds trigger on-chain relics and name/art updates.  
- **New Creator Tokens:** For other tokens launched on Higherrrrrrr, the 0.5% SOL fee may be **split** (e.g., 0.25% to protocol revenue, 0.25% to that token’s floor).

## 2. What’s the Higherrrrrrr Cult About?

**Higherrrrrrr** (with seven “r”s) is about being based while building an ever-evolving “cult coins.” Key bullet points:

- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 tokens, 9 decimals, no future minting (burn authority = gone).  
- **Evolutions**: Token’s on-chain name/art changes at certain thresholds—think “ritualistic transformations” but purely for hype.  
- **Conviction NFTs**: Holding at least **0.042069%** of the supply (420,690 tokens) grants special relic NFTs each time the token “levels up.”  

We aim to combine a dash of degenerate humor with robust on-chain engineering to keep the community engaged and entertained.

## 3. Distribution: Community Focus

### 3.1 Team & Future Expansions (20%)

- **Current Team (7.77%)**  
  - 3.33% to Carl (the main dev), the remainder to other team/advisors, all under a **12-month linear vesting schedule**.  
  - Held in a **Squads multisig**—no day-one dumps.  

- **Future Reserve (12.33%)**  
  - Marketing, strategic OTC sales, future contributors.  
  - Also locked in the **Squads multisig**; requires team/community approval for usage.

### 3.2 Migration LP Support\* (5%)

- Reserved for establishing and supporting a cross-token liquidity pool.  
- See [Appendix](#appendix) for details.

### 3.3 Base V1 Supporters\* (15%)

- Reserved for those who supported Higherrrrrrr V1 on Base.  
- See [Appendix](#appendix) for details.

### 3.4 Single-Sided Launch Pool (60%)

- Placed on Orca as a single-sided liquidity deposit for open trading.  
- Ensures broad distribution from day one, minimal slippage, and no insider advantage.

## 4. Evolution Mechanics

### 4.1 On-Chain Price/Cap Triggers

When the token crosses certain thresholds (price or market cap), we update the token’s metadata via **Metaplex**—shifting its name, art, or references. Think of it as “leveling up” each time the cult hits a new milestone.

### 4.2 The `evolution.svg` File

We store a file named `evolution.svg` that morphs at each threshold—introducing new relics, colors, or inside jokes. It’s basically a “cult tapestry” that gets upgraded over time.

### 4.3 Why Evolve?

- **Keeps It Fun**: Each threshold crossing is a community event for new memes.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Token explorers and wallets that respect Metaplex metadata will show these changes.  

---

## 5. Conviction NFTs (≥ 0.042069%)

### 5.1 The Zealot Threshold

Hold **0.042069%** of the supply (420,690 tokens) to become a “zealot.” This comedic figure ensures only big holders get the “cult relic” NFTs.

### 5.2 Registry & Rewards

An on-chain registry tracks addresses above 420,690 tokens. Whenever the token “levels up”:

- Everyone still on the registry can claim an NFT commemorating the “old level.”  
- If you dip below the threshold, you’re pruned.

---

## 6. Fees & Burning Mechanic

### 6.1 Trading Fees

A **1%** fee applies to every swap. It’s split into:

1. **Token Side (0.5%)**  
   - Burned outright—supply deflates continuously.

2. **SOL Side (0.5%)**  
   - Re-added as single-sided liquidity at a lower price range, creating an ever-stronger floor.

### 6.2 Pokémon Card Store Analogy

- **Buy/Sell** Pokémon cards at a local store.  
- The store **removes** some cards from circulation each time (burn).  
- The store keeps a portion of the cash (SOL) and uses it to **buy** more cards if prices dip, stabilizing the market.  

---

## 7. Team Vesting & Security

### 7.1 Team Reserves (20%)

- **7.77%** for current team/advisors:  
  - 12-month linear vesting schedule.  
- **12.33%** for future expansions, marketing, or partnerships.

All team tokens live in a **Squads multisig**, ensuring no single actor can dump or misappropriate.

### 7.2 Multi-Sig & Optional Immutability

A multi-sig (e.g., Squads) controls upgrade authority. If the community prefers, we can burn that authority for full immutability—no more changes possible.

---

## 8. Base V1 Supporters\* (15%)

A total of **15%** is reserved for these loyal participants. We’ll provide instructions on airdrops or bridging soon. Keep an eye on socials for updates.

---

## 9. Launch Plan & Liquidity

### 9.1 Single-Sided Liquidity

We deposit **60%** of the supply into Orca on day one as a single-sided token deposit. This ensures fair price discovery without big insider advantages.

### 9.2 Migration LP Support\* (5%)

A separate **migration-focused** liquidity pool will be seeded with 5% of the supply. See [Appendix](#appendix) for details.

### 9.3 Future Adjustments for New Tokens

- **For other tokens** launching under the Higherrrrrrr banner, the SOL side of fees (0.5%) can be **split** (e.g., 0.25% to protocol revenue, 0.25% to floor). The exact ratio is **globally adjustable** by the Higherrrrrrr team if needed.

---

## 10. Next Steps

1. **Check the Liquidity**: Once launched, you can buy/sell on Orca or via Jupiter.  
2. **Register if You’re a Zealot**: If you hit ≥ 420,690 tokens, call `register_holder`.  
3. **Watch the Art**: Keep an eye out for **`evolution.svg`** updates whenever thresholds are hit.  
4. **HODL or Trade**: Up to you—just remember, relic NFTs reward big holders.  
5. **Provide Feedback**: Suggest new slogans, relic ideas, or comedic thresholds.

---

## 11. Recap (Tech Scope)

- **Token Supply**: 1,000,000,000 total, no extra minting.  
- **Distribution**:  
  - 20% Team/Expansions (7.77% for current team w/ vesting, 12.33% for future uses)  
  - 5% Migration LP Support\*  
  - 15% Base V1 Supporters\*  
  - 60% Single-Sided Launch  
- **Evolutions**: On-chain comedic name changes, referencing `evolution.svg`.

- **Fees**:  
  - 1% total (0.5% burn + 0.5% single-sided SOL to the floor).  
  - **For new tokens**: 0.5% SOL is partially protocol revenue, partially floor liquidity (ratio adjustable).  
- **Upgrade**: Multi-sig, can be burned for immutability.

We invite you to jump in and help push **Higherrrrrrr** to comedic extremes. Stay tuned on your favorite channels, and let’s see how far we can take this meme.

## Appendix

### Base V1 Supporters\* (15%)
This allocation is reserved for the `$HARDER` and `$IDK` communities that supported the original Higherrrrrrr V1 launch on Base. We’ll finalize the airdrop or bridging mechanism for these tokens soon.

### Migration LP Support\* (5%)
Designated for the **HARDER/CULT** liquidity pool. The HARDER side is burned on each trade, while the CULT side directs 0.5% to the “floor” for price stability. This ensures a robust cross-token liquidity pool.
