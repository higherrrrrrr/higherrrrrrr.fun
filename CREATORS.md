## Introduction: Welcome to the Higher⁷verse

Hello there, and welcome to the most creator-friendly launchpad in crypto! I'm Phil, your dedicated guide in the Higher⁷verse. As a Creatooor, you’re not just here to launch a token; you’re here to create a Cult Coin that evolves, adapts, and inspires a thriving community. Our platform is built on three foundational pillars:

1. **Evolutionary Tokens and Conviction NFTs**  
2. **Fee Split and Flexible Tokenomics**  
3. **Community Engagement and Support**

Each of these pillars is designed to help you build a project that’s not only innovative in its technology but also deeply connected to its community. Let’s dive into each element in detail.

## 1. Evolving Tokens with On-Chain Thresholds

Higher⁷ introduces a groundbreaking mechanism: tokens that evolve automatically as they hit predefined market cap milestones. Inspired by the ever-changing nature of internet memes, this process is fully encoded on-chain to provide transparency and trust minimization.

### Key Features

- **Automated Milestone Updates**  
  - Each market cap threshold triggers an automated update to the token’s Metaplex metadata (name, symbol, and image).  
  - The changes reflect immediately on-chain—no manual re-uploads required.
  
- **Conviction NFTs**  
  - Holders who possess at least **0.042069%** of the total token supply (e.g., 420,690 tokens in a 1B supply) automatically qualify for a Conviction NFT.  
  - When the token reaches a new threshold, eligible holders can claim the NFT corresponding to that level—provided they register once on our frontend.  
  - **Important:** NFTs must be claimed *before* the token evolves to the next level. If a wallet’s holdings drop below the threshold, it will not qualify for future NFTs.
  - These NFTs not only symbolize commitment but may also offer exclusive perks like private game access, special Discord roles, or other rewards.

## 2. Fee Split & Flexible Tokenomics

Our platform offers creators unparalleled flexibility in designing tokenomics that align with your project’s goals. Here’s how Higher⁷’s tokenomics work:

### Pre-Mint and Team Allocation Options

- **Pre-Mint Options**  
  - You have the option to pre-mint tokens for your team—up to 15% of the total supply can be allocated.  
  - Vesting is optional but recommended for community optics. You can choose to vest all or part of this allocation.
  
### Single-Sided Liquidity Provision

- **Simplified Liquidity**  
  - Unlike protocols requiring pairing with SOL or another base asset, Higher⁷ allows you to provide single-sided liquidity using only your project’s token.  
  - The broader market supplies the corresponding SOL, resulting in a more organic price discovery process and simplifying liquidity management.

### Deflationary Mechanism & Fee Distribution

- **Swap Fee Structure**  
  - Every swap incurs a 1% fee, distributed as follows:
    - **0.5% Token Burn:** Permanently removes tokens from circulation to increase scarcity.
    - **0.25% SOL to Liquidity Floor:** Helps stabilize price fluctuations during dips.
    - **0.25% SOL to Higher⁷:** Supports platform development and maintenance (subject to change based on market conditions).
  
- **Creator Fee Splitting**  
  - You can configure how the 0.5% native token fee is allocated. Options include directing funds to a treasury, charity, or marketing efforts.
  
### An Analogy: Trading Pokémon Cards

Imagine buying and selling Pokémon cards. Each trade results in a few cards being removed from circulation (burned), and some cash being set aside to support the market during downturns. With fewer cards available, their value increases—creating a healthier, more vibrant ecosystem for everyone. That’s the essence of Higher⁷’s deflationary design.

## 3. Community

At Higher⁷, we believe that a strong community is as crucial as cutting-edge technology. Our ecosystem is designed to foster collaboration, support, and creativity.

### HiLites & Ascending

Projects that best leverage Higher⁷’s features can gain extra visibility:

- **HiLites**  
  - Projects featured as HiLites are pinned at the top of the Higher⁷ landing page.  
  - They come with an in-depth write-up by a Higher team member.
  - **Requirements:**
    - Team token allocation must be ≤15% with vesting.
    - Only 3.33% of tokens can unlock immediately; additional tokens must vest linearly.
    - Founders must be doxxed or have passed KYC (at least with Higher⁷).

- **Ascending**  
  - Projects that do not meet HiLites criteria but still stand out can be listed under Ascending.  
  - These projects enjoy flexible tokenomic requirements and are celebrated for their creative use of the platform’s features.

### How to Get Featured

1. **Join the Community:** Engage with us on Telegram and Twitter.
2. **Build a Badass Concept:** Ensure your idea aligns with the Higher⁷ ethos.
3. **Pitch or Submit a Proposal:** Active community members receive priority.

Even if you’re not featured as a HiLite or Ascending project, every Creatooor can create a lore page for their Cult Coin using our provided template.

### The Higherrrrrrr Hub

- **Dedicated Channels:** Join our Telegram community to collaborate, share ideas, and get assistance.
- **Collaboration and Networking:** Use the Hub to form teams, discuss launches, and gain exposure to talented vendors and collaborators.
- **Community Directory:** Our evolving directory lists trusted vendors for roles such as graphic design, mod services, and creative consultancy—helping you build your project with ease.

## 4. Twitter Agent Capabilities

Boost your project’s social presence with automated social media agents:

### Automated Social Media Agents

- **Large Language Model Integration:**  
  - Connect various language models to drive dynamic dialogue for your token’s social media presence.
  - Customize backstories, tone, and personality to match your project’s lore.
  
- **Scheduling & Interaction:**  
  - Set up scheduled posts or automated responses to community mentions.  
  - Enhance engagement by giving your Twitter agent a unique and engaging persona—be it a wise oracle, playful trickster, or cosmic traveler.

The better the personality and interaction, the more likely community members will share, discuss, and champion your Cult Coin.

## 5. Higherrrrrrr Content Guidelines

These Content Guidelines ensure that every project within the Higher⁷ ecosystem remains inclusive, innovative, and safe. They apply to token names, tickers, visual assets, metadata, descriptions, and all other related content.

Our primary objectives are to:

1. **Foster an inclusive and positive environment** for creators and users.
2. **Prevent harmful, hateful, or illegal content** from proliferating.
3. **Ensure compliance** with applicable laws and general community standards.

### 5.1 Scope & Enforcement

- **Who Must Comply:**  
  - Anyone creating or submitting a token/project through Higherrrrrrr—including third-party collaborators—must adhere to these guidelines.

- **Enforcement Mechanisms:**  
  - **Automated Screening:** AI tools scan token names, images, and metadata for disallowed content.
  - **Manual Review:** Moderators review flagged items to ensure accuracy.
  
- **Consequences:**  
  - Non-compliant tokens may be rejected, flagged for removal, or suspended until corrections are made.
  - Repeated or severe violations can lead to permanent bans from the platform.

### 5.2 Disallowed Content

Your project must **not** include, depict, or promote any of the following:

1. **Hate Speech & Harassment:**  
   - No slurs, stereotypes, or incitement of violence toward any protected group.
   
2. **Violent or Gory Imagery:**  
   - Avoid graphic violence or extreme brutality in visual or descriptive content.
   
3. **Sexual or Explicit Material:**  
   - No pornographic or exploitative sexual content, particularly involving minors or explicit graphic depictions.
   
4. **Illegal or Dangerous Activities:**  
   - Content that encourages violent, self-harm, or illegal behavior (including drug promotion, hacking, piracy, etc.) is strictly prohibited.
   
5. **Fraudulent or Malicious Intent:**  
   - Do not impersonate other brands, include phishing links, or create deceptive content designed to scam or mislead users.

   - Unauthorized sharing of personal data or attempts to reveal private information is forbidden.
   
8. **Trademark / Copyright Infringement:**  
   - Do not use copyrighted or trademarked content without proper authorization. Even satirical references must respect fair use guidelines.

### 5.3 Potentially Sensitive or Edgy Content

We understand that meme culture often pushes boundaries with edgy humor. However:

- **Mild Satire & Comedic References:** Allowed if they remain within acceptable limits.
- **Exaggerated Imagery:** Permitted if the portrayal is cartoonish and clearly intended as satire—not realistic or hateful.

### 5.4 Community Conduct Requirements

- **Respect:**  
  - Treat all community members, moderators, and collaborators with courtesy and respect.
  
- **No Trolling / Spam:**  
  - Malicious spamming or inflammatory behavior is not tolerated.
  
- **No Misinformation:**  
  - Projects should avoid spreading falsehoods—especially regarding critical topics like health or finance. Satirical projects must clearly indicate their intent.

### 5.5 AI / Automated Screening Process

Our submission process includes several layers of content review:

1. **Token Name & Ticker Analysis:**  
   - AI tools check for hate terms, profanity, extremist references, or trademarked terms.
   
2. **Image / Metadata Scan:**  
   - On-chain images and metadata are scanned for explicit or disallowed visuals.
   
3. **Contextual Interpretation:**  
   - References that are comedic or ironic may be flagged initially but can be approved after manual review.
   
4. **Review & Approval:**  
   - If automated checks pass, your project proceeds. If flagged, our moderation team investigates further before a final decision is made.

### 5.6 Reporting Mechanisms

If you encounter content or projects that violate these guidelines, please report them to our moderators via our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/+Y0XJwPzrdUc2OGRh). Higherrrrrrr reserves the right to temporarily remove or suspend suspicious content pending investigation.

### 5.7 Future Amendments & Community Input

The Higher⁷ ecosystem evolves alongside community feedback. As such:

- **Amendment Proposals:**  
  - Community members can suggest changes via our governance process or dedicated channels.
  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Any changes will be reviewed thoroughly by the Higherrrrrrr team before being enacted.

### 5.8 Disclaimer

- **Baseline Guidelines:**  
  - These guidelines serve as the baseline. Additional local or international laws may also apply.
  
- **Liability:**  
  - Higherrrrrrr is not liable for user-generated content but is committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
